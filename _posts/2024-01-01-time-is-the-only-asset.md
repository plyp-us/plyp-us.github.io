# You get 86400 secs/day, 30 or 31 days/month.

We use EVERY second.

*We train* ***constantly***, *but we don't JUST train ... WE TRAIN WITH CONSTANCY OF INTENTION ... and that SECOND-by-SECOND habit, or the discipline of constant focus on increasing freedom, occupies our mind in each second of the 86400 second day.*

As we try to train, working on our improving our DISCIPLINE.  When we repeat our mantra that ***DISCIPLINE equals FREEDOM*** we mean that we train mentally and physically being present and focused in **each second** of our 86400 second day ... so that we develop discipline WITH MINDFUL INTENTION in order to establish the habit of becoming more FREE than we are now.  *We train constantly, but we don't JUST train ... WE TRAIN WITH INTENTION ... and that habit, or the discipline of increasing freedom, occupies our mind in each second of the 86400 second day.*

We time-block our day into forty-eight 30 minute time blocks ... the 30 minutes is comprised partially of a 25 minute pomodoros of intellectual knowledge engineering mental work, but the 4-minute TABATA physical rills which are spaced in-between may be more important for our mental discipline -- another part of the discipline includes two 30 second readjusts to go from intellectual-to-physical and physical to intellectual focus, ie the switch is important.

Every waking moment is about training ... when we sleep, we try to sleep ... but when we can't sleep, we get up an train ... when we fell too tired to train, we take a 25 minute nap. Generally, we get up when we feel like it; we take naps when we want, so those 30 minute time-blocks float ... EXCEPT when we have a scheduled meeting with someone ... naturally, because of how fixed meetings disrupt our schedulue, we detest meetings and instead attempt to move our workflow into an assynchronous workflow ... elimination of meetings, while continuing to engage with people, what our [ASYNCH.work](https://www.asynch.work) project is about.

In this day in age, that we augment our own human intelligence with the intelligence of crowds as we dogfood the development the artificial intelligence in the toolchains we use as we train in the knowledge engineering discipline. Training with intenion is thus a thoroughly recursive mindset ... it's a knowledge flywheel which we try to spin up in the morning and then keep spinning all day long until we're exhausted ... it is always about training to be better able to train ... our training is always intentional in that we work trying to improve the discipline of optimizing our NOW. 

*We train constantly, but we don't JUST train ... WE TRAIN WITH INTENTION ... and that habit, or the discipline of increasing freedom, occupies our mind in each second of the 86400 second day.*

# Plan each month now to KNOW your WHY.

***KNOWING your WHY is about YOU setting YOUR agenda.***

Each month, throughout the year, we try to focus particularly on one area of our guru DISCIPLINE, but we use and try to strengthen each one of these areas of DISCIPLINE with every second of every day ... this is our schedule for this year.  For example, in January, we try a bit harder to to really THINK through our entire year's plan, because planning is all about really ***KNOWING our WHY*** and making that WHY a reality with our actual time ... thus, *knowing your why* is all about SETTING THE AGENDA, to drive your reality toward your disciplined agenda.

1) Time's the ONLY asset we have. You get 86400 secs/day, 30 or 31 days/month. Plan each month to know your WHY.

2) Avoid idiot compassion. Learn to FORGIVE without forgetting lessons learned. Never HATE, either yourself or others.

3) Pray without ceasing. Synch your will to your Creator's. Focus with reverent intent to fully OWN the DISCIPLINE. 

4) Your method for setting goals, planning tasks becomes your day, your life. Return to basics, eg 30 min time-block.

5) 30 minutes is split into a 25 min MENTAL focus, 4 min focused PHYSICAL exercise Tabata and two 30 sec readjusts.

6) Plan with reverence; set aside one 30 min block to *sharpen the axe* or optimize each of the other time blocks.

7) Devote one entire 30 minute block each day to housekeeping or 5S-ing your work environment; set things in order.

8) Based on experience, optimize the time-blocking details to predictably develop plans, set agendas, get tasks done.

9) Always be flanking! Cheat! Steal lifehacks that work! Experiment with new systems of time mgmt and organization.

10) Stop weakening the body; remove chairs, avoid most sitting; continuously strengthen your [musculoskeletal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system).

11) Minimalism = gratitude. Ditch all vulnerabilities causing worry. Give stuff away; don't rest or be owned by your stuff.

12) As you go thru each day CONTINUOUS COMPOUND mental discipline; focus on the NOWNESS of improvement discipline.

Obviously, plans need to adust and adapt -- so as we go through each day of the year, we are evaluating whether or not the plan is still the best plan ... but any adaptations to that plan must be in line with KNOWING our WHY, ie this is why we LEAD and NEVER follow celebrities, fearmonging from any news source or anyone else's agenda. ***KNOWING your WHY is about YOU setting YOUR agenda for each time-block in the day, each day in the month, each month in the year.***
